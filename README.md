# DevOps-Project-C#
In this project, I have configuired Jenkins CI/CD. If there are any changes in code(Jenkins will know when there is change due to GitHub Hooks), the code will get pulled into CI server, then tests will be run. If all tests pass the code changes will be reflected in a mock server.
